What?

- Like a linked list (stacks vertical) queue (horizontal)
- Data Structure (some construct to organize the flow of data processing)
- "Stack overflow" Stack as a memory structure
- "push" "pop"

Why?

- In older languages we had to use these for memory access and storage to optimize our code
- utility to track a list of things to be done

How?

- base assumed methods (common methods) you will see on these structures
- Queue: "Cutting in/jumping the line is NOT allowed!!"
